# Tattox-Store (DEPRECATED)
An spa aplication made with firebase-vuejs-Tailwindss

This Web - App was made with VUEJS 3.6.0, Tailwindss and Firebase

# LAUNCH PROJECT
Use a local host server and remember put your Firebase credentials 

```
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: APIKEY,
    authDomain: AUTHDOMAIN,
    projectId: PROJECTID,
    storageBucket: STORAGEBUCKET,
    messagingSenderId: MESSAGINGSENDERID,
    databaseURL: DATABASEURL,
    storageBucket: STORAGEBUCKET,
    appId: APPID

  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

# DEPRECTED REASONS
- The project uses Vue 3.6.0 CDN import mode and his VueRouter, this functionality was deprecated so it's not working.
